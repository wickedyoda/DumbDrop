## Quick Start

## Production Deployment with Docker

### Option 1: Docker (For Dummies)

```bash
# Pull and run with one command
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v ./uploads:/app/uploads ghcr.io/wickedyoda/dumbdrop:latest
```

1. Go to <http://localhost:3000>
2. Upload a File - It'll show up in ./uploads
3. Celebrate on how dumb easy this was

### Option 2: Docker Compose (For Dummies who like customizing)

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  dumbdrop:
    image: ghcr.io/wickedyoda/dumbdrop:latest
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      # Where your uploaded files will land
      - ./uploads:/app/uploads
    environment:
      # Explicitly set upload directory inside the container
      UPLOAD_DIR: /app/uploads
      # The title shown in the web interface
      DUMBDROP_TITLE: WickedYoda's DumbDrop
      # Maximum file size in MB
      MAX_FILE_SIZE: 1024
      # Optional PIN protection (leave empty to disable)
      DUMBDROP_PIN: 123456
      # Upload without clicking button
      AUTO_UPLOAD: false
      # The base URL for the application
      # You must update this to the url you use to access your site
      BASE_URL: http://localhost:3000
```

Then run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

1. Go to <http://localhost:3000>
2. Upload a File - It'll show up in ./uploads
3. Rejoice in the glory of your dumb uploads

> **Note:** The `UPLOAD_DIR` environment variable is now explicitly set to `/app/uploads` in the container. The Dockerfile only creates the `uploads` directory, not `local_uploads`. The host directory `./uploads` is mounted to `/app/uploads` for persistent storage.

- **UPLOAD_DIR** is used in Docker/production. If not set, LOCAL_UPLOAD_DIR is used for local development. If neither is set, the default is `./local_uploads`.
- **FILE_RETENTION** supports days or hours using suffix format like `30d` or `12h`.
- **Docker Note:** The Dockerfile now only creates the `uploads` directory inside the container. The host's `./local_uploads` is mounted to `/app/uploads` and should be managed on the host system.
- **BASE_URL**: If you are deploying DumbDrop under a subpath (e.g., `https://example.com/watchfolder/`), you **must** set `BASE_URL` to the full path including the trailing slash (e.g., `https://example.com/watchfolder/`). All API and asset requests will be prefixed with this value. If you deploy at the root, use `https://example.com/`.
- **BASE_URL** must end with a trailing slash. The app will fail to start if this is not the case.
- **PUBLIC_DOMAIN** controls generated direct download links. Set this when users access DumbDrop through a public hostname/reverse proxy so links never use internal/localhost values.
- Generated download links use short root-level format: `https://your-domain.tld/filename.ext` (or `https://your-domain.tld/folder/filename.ext`).
- Link generation uses **PUBLIC_DOMAIN** (or falls back to the origin from **BASE_URL** when `PUBLIC_DOMAIN` is not set).
- Direct download URLs are publicly accessible by design. Keep the legal warning visible and avoid uploading sensitive files.

See `.env.example` for a template and more details.

<summary>Reverse Proxy Configuration (TRUST_PROXY)</summary>

### Important Security Notice

By default, DumbDrop **does not** trust proxy headers like `X-Forwarded-For`. This prevents attackers from spoofing IP addresses to bypass rate limiting and PIN brute-force protection.

### When to Enable TRUST_PROXY

Only enable `TRUST_PROXY=true` if you are deploying DumbDrop behind a **trusted reverse proxy** such as:

- Nginx
- Apache
- Caddy
- Traefik
- Cloudflare
- Other CDN or load balancer

### Basic Configuration

If behind a single reverse proxy:

```env
TRUST_PROXY=true
```

### Advanced Configuration (Recommended)

For additional security, specify the exact IP addresses of your trusted proxies:

```env
TRUST_PROXY=true
TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS=172.17.0.1,10.0.0.1
```

**Common proxy IPs:**

- Docker default bridge: `172.17.0.1`
- Docker Compose networks: Check with `docker network inspect <network_name>`
- Nginx/Apache on same host: `127.0.0.1` or `::1`
- External proxy: Use the actual IP of your proxy server

### Security Warnings

⚠️ **DO NOT enable `TRUST_PROXY` if:**

- DumbDrop is directly accessible from the internet
- You are unsure whether you have a reverse proxy
- You cannot verify the proxy IP addresses

⚠️ **Enabling proxy trust without a properly configured reverse proxy allows attackers to bypass security measures by spoofing headers.**

### Examples for Common Setups

**Nginx Reverse Proxy:**

```env
TRUST_PROXY=true
TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS=172.17.0.1
```

**Cloudflare:**

```env
TRUST_PROXY=true
# List Cloudflare IPs or use their published IP ranges
```

**Direct Access (No Proxy):**

```env
# TRUST_PROXY=false (default - no need to set)
```

<details>
<summary>ALLOWED_IFRAME_ORIGINS (DEPRECATED: see ALLOWED_ORIGINS)</summary>

- This is now deprecated but still works for backwards compatibility
- ALLOWED_IFRAME_ORIGINS will be used as a fallback if ALLOWED_ORIGINS is not set
- Please update to ALLOWED_ORIGINS for future compatibility

~~To allow this app to be embedded in an iframe on specific origins (such as Organizr), set the `ALLOWED_IFRAME_ORIGINS` environment variable. For example:~~

```env
ALLOWED_IFRAME_ORIGINS=https://organizr.example.com,https://myportal.com
```

- ~~If not set, the app will only allow itself to be embedded in an iframe on the same origin (default security).~~
- ~~If set, the app will allow embedding in iframes on the specified origins and itself.~~
- ~~**Security Note:** Only add trusted origins. Allowing arbitrary origins can expose your app to clickjacking and other attacks.~~

</details>

<details>
<summary>ALLOWED_ORIGINS</summary>

By default `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is set to '\*'

```env
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://organizr.example.com,https://myportal.com,http://internalip:port
```

- If you would like to restrict CORS to your BASE_URL, you can set it like this: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000`
- If you would like to allow multiple origins, you can set it like this: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://internalip:port,https://subdomain.domain.tld`
  - This will automatically include your BASE_URL in the list of allowed origins.

</details>

<details>
<summary>File Extension Filtering</summary>

To restrict which file types can be uploaded, set the `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` environment variable. For example:

```env
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS=.jpg,.jpeg,.png,.pdf,.doc,.docx,.txt
```

If not set, all file extensions will be allowed.

</details>

<details>
<summary>File Listing and Management</summary>

To enable the file listing feature that shows uploaded files with download and delete functionality, set the `SHOW_FILE_LIST` environment variable:

```env
SHOW_FILE_LIST=true
```

When enabled, this feature provides:

- **File Listing**: Displays all uploaded files and folders in a hierarchical structure
- **Download**: Direct download links for individual files
- **Delete**: Ability to delete files and entire folders (including all contents)
- **Statistics**: Shows total number of files and total storage used
- **Refresh**: Manual refresh button to update the file list
- **Folder Support**: Properly displays folder structures with nested files

**Security Note:** The file listing respects the same security measures as the upload functionality. If a PIN is configured, users must authenticate before accessing file management features.

The file list automatically refreshes after successful uploads to keep the display current.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Notification Setup</summary>

#### Message Templates

The notification message supports the following placeholders:

- `{filename}`: Name of the uploaded file
- `{size}`: Size of the file (formatted according to APPRISE_SIZE_UNIT)
- `{storage}`: Total size of all files in upload directory

Example message template:

```env
APPRISE_MESSAGE=New file uploaded {filename} ({size}), Storage used {storage}
```

Size formatting examples:

- Auto (default): Chooses nearest unit (e.g., "1.44MB", "256KB")
- Fixed unit: Set APPRISE_SIZE_UNIT to B, KB, MB, GB, or TB

Both {size} and {storage} use the same formatting rules based on APPRISE_SIZE_UNIT.

#### Notification Support

- Integration with [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-notifications) for flexible notifications
- Support for all Apprise notification services
- Customizable notification messages with filename templating
- Optional - disabled if no APPRISE_URL is set

## Security

### Security Controls

- Variable-length PIN support (4-10 digits)
- Constant-time PIN comparison
- Input sanitization
- Rate limiting with IP-based tracking
- Protection against IP spoofing attacks
- Configurable proxy trust for reverse proxy deployments
- File extension filtering
- No client-side PIN storage
- Secure file handling

### Security Best Practices

1. **PIN Protection**: Always set a strong PIN when deploying publicly
2. **Proxy Trust**: Only enable `TRUST_PROXY` when behind a verified reverse proxy
3. **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production (handled by your reverse proxy)
4. **File Extensions**: Restrict allowed file types using `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` if possible
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep DumbDrop and its dependencies up to date

## Technical Details
